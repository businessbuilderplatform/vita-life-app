  databaseSize: async () => {
    // Check Supabase storage usage
    const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_db_size')
    if (data > 400) { // 80% of 500MB limit
      console.warn('Database approaching storage limit')
    }
  },
  
  errorRate: async () => {
    // Monitor error rates via Sentry
    const errorRate = await getSentryErrorRate()
    if (errorRate > 0.05) { // 5% error rate
      console.warn('High error rate detected')
